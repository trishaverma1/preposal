# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Codem√≥n Quest.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Coding game website that teaches python coding, while also making a fun game that kids can play! The games will incorporate bonus levels where kids can answer small quizzes about python code in order to earn players Pokemon cards. Games will include card games, such as Blackjack, Go Fish, and Uno, and other games such as Pacman, Flappy Bird, Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku, Wordle. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will code for a few games that a user can play! In each game the user has the opportunity to answer python questions and if they get it right, they can win a pokemon card (it will be randomized). Moreover, the user can play the game itself and if they win, they get another chance to win a pokemon card! The user can continue to play all the games and the goal will be to get as many pokemon cards as possible. 

There will be a section of the website where players can view all their collected cards. 

This will be executed using Python (and Pygame), as well as other languages (possibly) such as Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

We are not! 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Trisha Verma - tur00181@temple.edu (TA: Parsa)
Tara Kehair - tur39462@temple.edu (TA: Parsa)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for our project would be for us to create a code that allows the user to input which game they would want to play from a given list. From there the code will send the user to the game where they can play it and answer python questions to win a random pokemon card as the prize. The games such as black-jack, wordle, go-fish and tic-tac-toe would be easier to code.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for our project would be for the user to play a Pokemon game using these cards. It would consist of more games than in the good outcome.These games would include Sudoku, Go Fish, Uno, etc. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for our final project would be a full website with graphics that allows the player to choose the games and pages that they want. The user would be able to use the points from other games to buy different Pokemon cards (generic or rare ones). This would require languages other than Python and encoding Python with the website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first skill we will need to acquire is learning how to use Pygames and its features. From there we can experiment with using the platform and begin trying to code games. If we attempt to build a website we will have to research how to incorporate code into that (https://pyscript.net/). Both of us will need to learn how to use Pygames and we will split up who codes what game. We will make the pokemon random generator graphics together (using images and code!).
